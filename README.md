# Solutions to the Cryptopals Crypto Challenges

## What

The Crytopals Crypto Challenges is a collection of excercises that demonstrate attacks on real-world crypto.
For more information, visit https://cryptopals.com.

## Why

There two reasons why I decided to participate in these challenges:
- to learn about crytography by solving real-world problems rather than taking a class or reading a book,
- to implement all the solutions in Rust and thus get to know the language better
